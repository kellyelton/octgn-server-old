-No need for hamachi! 
  To Host: Just go to the 'Games' tab, pick your game from the dropdown box, and click 'Host'!(If you are hosting you won't see your own game on the list.
  To Join: Just click the game and click 'Join'! It's that simple!
  Note: If you host or join games the standard way with the 'Start a new game' or 'Join an existing game' buttons you will still need Hamachi if you can't normally host.
-Able to play against people with the original client(Sometimes)

Have fun!
